# NeoInked

NeoInked is a dark theme for VSCode that was made because dark+ can still be too light and other themes dont use all the colors I like

## Preview

![NeoInked Theme Preview](images/file_cpp_preview.png)
NeoInked currently has been tested on : C/C++, Rust, Javascript, Python, HTML, CSS, Markdown, and plain text files.

## Installation
Go to VSCode marketplace and search up NeoInked and click install 
<br> You can also go to the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nlamp.neoinked) and install manually

## Customization

If you want to customize the theme, you can do so by creating a `settings.json` file in your `.vscode` folder and adding the following code:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorTheme": "NeoInked",
  "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "comments": "#888888",
    "strings": "#ff0000",
    "numbers": "#008000"
  }
}
```
